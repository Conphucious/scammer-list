## Alexander Patton Smith

**Description**: Alex Smith (age 26 or 33 at the time) of Cincinnati, Ohio (45216) sold a 2007 RX-8 on 06/23/2022 on the `CarsAndBids` platform. After the auction, I texted him to get the transportation setup and wired him the money. Only AFTER I wired him the money, did he mentioned that the keyfob may or may not work which is critical for vehicle operation as it has keyless entry/ignition (GT). BOTH key fobs did not work and one of the keyfobs does not even hold the key. He failed to mention the broken center console lid, the loose passenger side door handle, the multiple golf ball sized dents on the side of the vehicle, and the leaky gas cap. 

On Friday (07/01/2022) 4:23 PM, Alex agreed to replace both key fobs, the broken center console lid, and the leaky gas cap. The following day (Saturday), he started saying the replacement would be $80 which it would not be ($500 since both key fobs do not work and 2 are required for programming a new one). 

On Sunday (07/03/2022) at 9 AM, Alex rescinded his offer to pay for a replacement. He said I got a good deal for the car *mind you I paid over market price) and that the car sold for under what he wanted despite it going over reserve and going over what he said he wanted on a reddit post under the username `pimpychimp`. He then agreed to pay for half of the replacement cost. He said he wanted some time and asked for Tuesday to send the money.

On Wednesday (07/06/2022) at 8:51 AM, I reached out to Alex to ask about the agreed amount of $350 (Half of key replacement, center console and leaky gas cap replacement). He replied at 12:42 PM once again kept insisting the key fob would not be much money. After I told him this is what the dealership quoted me and asked for an updated later at 9PM, I got no reply. He ghosted me. I may pursue legal small claims if deemed possible. 

**Other PII Information**: He drives a black CX-30 (could be a CX-50 now). Loves the Manchester United F.C. Red Devils. Has a dog, wife, and one kid on the way as of July 2022.
